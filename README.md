# Simple-3D-Engine-Java
This is a simple 3D engine made without external libraries except java Graphics. I do not recommend using this, because there are much better options like LWJGL or OpenGL. 

Features:
  - Move the camera with the W, A, S, D keys and the UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT arrows to explore the scene.
  - Load your own .obj files or modify worlds' data to make your own scenes.
